<p>This will be an experiment. If it works well, it will allow me to hold office hours regularly on Thursdays (when demand is probably higher) as opposed to Friday right before class (which is probably a very stressful time to be coming to OH). Plus, you don&#39;t have to leave the comfort of your dorm room. So wins all around. :-) </p>

Some of you submitted definitions from other fields, and we would encourage you to go back through and review the slides. </li><li><strong>Recall</strong> is the ratio of (true positives)/(true positives &#43; false negatives). For our data set, this was the probability that an article about gun violence would be given a positive label by our classifier.

It&#39;s easy to see that minor injuries are unlikely to be reported, that areas with less media coverage are less likely to be scraped (some of you started with the New York Times and the LA Times, but nobody checked any newspapers from the middle of nowhere), that reporting around gun violence can be sensationalized and since we aren&#39;t deduplicating results yet, there are likely repeat incidents that were reported on at multiple URLs you submitted.

<p></p>
<ul><li>The <strong>hourly wage</strong> referred to what the workers completing your job earned (you can view this value on Crowdflower&#39;s analytics tab). Without simply paying more per task, the other variable we could affect was the amount of time it takes to complete. Making the links clickable, scraping the text of the article and uploading that to Crowdflower instead of URLs, and providing clear, unambiguous directions to make deciding the label easier were all great ways, but there&#39;s a lot that we can do on this side. </li><li><strong>Precision</strong> is the ratio of true positives over all positives, or the probability that once your classifier has labeled an article as gun violence, it&#39;s actually about an instance of gun violence. This differed from <strong>accuracy</strong> because accuracy is the ratio of correct labels over all labels (true positives &#43; true negatives)/(all positives &#43; all negatives). Some of you submitted definitions from other fields, and we would encourage you to go back through and review the slides. </li><li><strong>Recall</strong> is the ratio of (true positives)/(true positives &#43; false negatives). For our data set, this was the probability that an article about gun violence would be given a positive label by our classifier. We couldn&#39;t calculate that because we only gave the Crowdflower workers positively-labeled data, and therefore can&#39;t draw any conclusions about the number of false negatives in our labels. </li><li>Within the <strong>Bing API</strong> piece, many of the titles submitted were &#34;News Result.&#34; This is a field in the Bing API, but doesn&#39;t correspond to the actual title of the article (or it would be very difficult to decide which articles to read). </li><li>There are a lot of sources of <strong>bias</strong> in the way that we collected data. One of our goals is to minimize this. It&#39;s easy to see that minor injuries are unlikely to be reported, that areas with less media coverage are less likely to be scraped (some of you started with the New York Times and the LA Times, but nobody checked any newspapers from the middle of nowhere), that reporting around gun violence can be sensationalized and since we aren&#39;t deduplicating results yet, there are likely repeat incidents that were reported on at multiple URLs you submitted. There are other sources too, and thinking about this is an important part of building a comprehensive system to measure anything (not just gun violence). </li><li>Some of you got really original with what you named the files that you submitted. While we appreciate your creative genius, it makes it a lot easier to grade when the names of files approximately correspond to what&#39;s in them.
