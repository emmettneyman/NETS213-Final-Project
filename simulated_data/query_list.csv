Question about grade,"<p>I got .5 points off &#34;for not using the crawler to collect URLs in addition to the Bing API&#34; -- my collected URLs included URLs from the Gun Violence Archive, and I collected the rest using the Bing API. </p>

<p>The instructions didn&#39;t specify that we necessarily needed to use other methods to get 2500 URLs. The homework says to &#34;turn in a list of at least 2,500 urls, including some crawled from the Gun Violence Archive and some obtained using the Bing API.&#34; </p>

HIT #1 (bad design) clarification,"<p>The example of the HIT posted on the assignment shows not just the URL and text, but also the date published and title of the article. But the instructions of the assignment say to use the URL and text file we made as the data for this HIT (which does not contain published date or title). Thus, do we not need to copy the demo exactly and ignore the extraction of the date and title? I am assuming that those details are not even needed until the 2nd HIT we design.</p>"
Video submission,"<p>I created a Powerpoint and recorded my voice to go along with it, but for some reason, when I export it as a .mov it gets corrupted and doesn&#39;t play the audio.

Failures on MTurk,"<p>When our group tried to upload HITs to the MTurk sandbox, we saw that we got a couple of failures. The number of failures went down after a little while, but we still ended up with a couple with the error as &#34;throttled&#34;. Is this normal behavior for the sandbox?

Welcome to Piazza!,"
Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:

1.  <b>Ask questions!</b>

The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).

2.  <b>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</b>

Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <b>students' answer</b> that students can edit collectively (and a single <b>instructors’ answer</b> for instructors).

3.  <b>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</b>

To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <b>followup discussion</b>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.

4.  <b>Go anonymous.</b>

Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.

5.  <b>Tag your posts.</b>

It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.

6.  <b>Format code and equations.</b>

Adding a code snippet? Click the <b>pre</b> or <b>tt</b> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. 
Mathematical equation? Click the <b>Fx</b> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.

7.  <b>View and download class details and resources.</b>

Click the <b>Course Page</b> button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!


Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at <b>team@piazza.com</b>. We love feedback!"

Statistical Analysis Taking A Very Long Time,"<p>Hi, so I read though the other piazza post about how the statistical analysis takes a long time, but I am still having some trouble with my code.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have already tried waiting 10-15 minutes and removing all stopwords, but for some reason the statistical analysis refuses to complete in a reasonable amount of time</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is my code:</p>
<pre>def isStopWord(word):
	with open(&#39;stopwords.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as stopwords:
		for line in stopwords:
			if word in line:
				return True
		return False

def get_features(X) : 
	features = []
	for x in X : 
		f = {}
		#TODO replace this dummy feature function with a unigram model, like we did in class
		for word in x.split():
			if isStopWord(word):
				continue
			if word in f:
				f[word] = f[word] &#43; 1.0
			else:
				f[word] =  1.0
		features.append(f)
	return features</pre>

Something interesting I found when resetting my Snapchat password,"<p>Today, I reset my Snapchat password and discovered something very interesting. Instead of doing the traditional &#34;type the letters you see in the box below&#34; CAPTCHA, Snapchat&#39;s equivalent was asking me &#34;Which of the following are pictures of mountains?&#34; and displaying 9 images above that text, some of which were mountains and some of which were not. Now, I assume that they knew that some of those were definitely mountains (&#34;gold labels&#34;) but, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I believe they were using me to help label their images for free, and I, as the &#34;contributor,&#34; did not have much choice since I forgot my password. Genius!</p>"

<p>&#34;For an objective assessment of her program’s work, Harmon recruited subjects from Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a pilot study, people read FIGURE8’s more complex sentences. But the task seemed to wear them out. “It became more of an English assignment,” she says. So for the <a href=""http://axon.cs.byu.edu/ICCC2015proceedings/4.1Harmon.pdf"">study</a> she presented at this year’s International Conference on Computational Creativity, Harmon restricted her program to simple sentences that fit certain patterns. It wasn’t FIGURE8’s most thrilling writing, but these shorter phrases would be easier for subjects to compare.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each person read sets of five FIGURE8 sentences at a time. People ranked the similes for their clarity, as well as how enjoyable they were to read. Harmon then compared those ratings to scores the computer program had given itself for clarity and overall quality. Harmon found that her subjects’ ratings were pretty close to how FIGURE8 rated itself. For example, humans and computer agreed that <em>The queen stands like a strong castle</em> was a good, clear simile. But they also agreed that <em>It was her pearl, crumpling like a drowned corpse </em>didn’t make much sense.&#34;</p>"
Participation,"<p>Hi, so over the weekend I got a concussion and I am not supposed to be leaving my dorm to go to class these next few days, but I&#39;ve been following along today online with the firearm violence lecture notes.

Questions 9 &amp; 10: Red and White reviews,<p>What exactly is meant by the words in the &#34;red&#34; reviews that DO NOT appear in the &#34;white&#34; reviews? Does this mean we should not count a word that appears in a red review and at least one white review? Or is this simply a check for reviews that have both &#34;red&#34; and &#34;white&#34; in them (and thus we can&#39;t classify the words as either red or white)? </p>
Grades Released for Homework 1: Becoming a Crowdworker,"<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Grades for the first assignment have been emailed to your Penn email addresses. If you did not receive an email with your grade (and have checked your spam folder), please reach out to me immediately so we can resolve it. Overall, we were very happy with your participation and takeaways from your experience as crowdworkers. You can expect your grades for the second assignment very soon as well, and we encourage you to incorporate any feedback on your company profile into the video (Ellie&#39;s post on takeaways for the entire course will also be helpful for this). </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have questions about your grade, please don&#39;t respond directly to the score email. You&#39;ll get a much better response time if you post privately to Piazza or email the entire teaching staff at <a href=""mailto:nets213&#64;googlegroups.com"">nets213-staff&#64;googlegroups.com</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We&#39;ll be getting the next few assignments out to you as soon as possible so that you can assess how the class is going. One upcoming date to be aware of is the drop deadline on February 19th. If you are concerned about how you are doing at any point, please talk to a member of the teaching staff. </p>"

Image datasets?,"<p>I&#39;m working on the current homework. My group would like to do the experiment &#34;Financial Incentives and the Performance of Crowds&#34;, but we need a large dataset of images. Do you have any suggestions for where we could get such a dataset?</p>"
Wednesday&#39;s Class,<p>Hello! Just curious: is there any benefit in coming to class tomorrow if you already have a full team? Or is the team-matchmaking the only activity planned for tomorrow?</p>

<p>Abstract: </p>
<p>IMAGINE IF GOVERNMENT COULD QUICKLY GET ADVICE from infectious disease experts in the event of a pandemic, or find and reach out to cyber-security professionals following an infrastructure attack, or pose questions about our public challenges to data scientists. From combatting terrorism to safeguarding the future of the planet, society will confront unprecedented challenges over the next decades. To succeed, Noveck argues, we have to run our institutions differently. Getting ideas from outside - often called crowdsourcing or open innovation - should be just as vital for the improvement of public institutions as it has been for success in commerce and science. Data science tools hold the potential to transform how we govern by making it possible to solve hard problems through the diverse and distributed expertise of the many citizens who would be willing to contribute their talents, skills, expertise and enthusiasm to the public good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Excerpt: &#34;Changing how we make decisions will depend squarely on having the personnel who embrace openness and collaboration. The recognition of citizen expertise does not mean jettisoning the professionals and substituting some kind of web-based plebiscite-far from it. Making good use of citizen expertise will require even better-trained managers and leaders. This new breed of professional-if we can call it that with a wink and a nod-will need to know how to work and talk and decide with citizens rather than for them. Just as the next generation will need to know how to govern with big and open data, predictive analytics, and real-time indicators, they will also need to develop the skillset for managing the conversation to get at the intelligence necessary to govern in a complex society.&#34; - From <em>Smart Citizens, Smarter State</em></p>"
Crowdflower question creation,"<p>I&#39;m having an issue in the last part of the assignment creating the questions that require information from the spreadsheet. For example, for the question &#34;In what city did the incident take place?&#34; I am trying to add {{city_1}} as an option in the question so that the information from the spreadsheet will populate that field, but I get this error: &#34;&#39;{{city_1}}&#39; will show up in your results as &#39;city_1&#39;, which already exists as a header in your uploaded data.&#34; How can I achieve what is supposed to happen, instead of getting this error?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>"

Statistical Analysis &#34;Killed&#34; - even on biglab,"<p>My script runs forever on my virtual machine, so I&#39;m running it off of biglab.

Ellie&#39;s Office Hours today,"<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I will be holding virtual office hours today from 4-6. If you want help during that time, sign up by putting your name and gmail address in this spreadsheet, and I will call you on Google Hangouts when its your turn. </p>

<p>This will be an experiment. If it works well, it will allow me to hold office hours regularly on Thursdays (when demand is probably higher) as opposed to Friday right before class (which is probably a very stressful time to be coming to OH). Plus, you don&#39;t have to leave the comfort of your dorm room. So wins all around. :-) </p>

The company has been in operation in the US for nearly 5 years now, and provides data to some of the world&#39;s largest hedge funds. The company&#39;s website (<a href=""http://www.estimize.com"">http://www.estimize.com</a>) contains open estimates for any individual stock, as well as specific macroeconomic indicators that report nearly daily in the US. Any individual (student, professor, financial analysts, independent investors, hedge fund analysts, etc.) can sign up and submit estimates on the platform, anonymous or not. Please let me know if I am able to do my report on Estimize. I can provide more information if needed.</p>

Reducing Worker Quality to One Value,"<p>To clarify this calculation, I understand that you should multiply the following: (accuracy when label is porn = P,P)(% of URLs which are porn) &#43; (accuracy when label is not porn = NP, NP)(% of URLs which are not porn). Just to clarify this further, if we are calculating worker quality for iteration 2, do we take the % of URLs that are porn and not porn from the true labels we calculated in iteration 2 or the ones we calculated iteration 1. I guess I am confused because we calculated the URL true labels and majority vote of iteration 2 based on the worker qualities of iteration 2. Correct me if I am wrong. Thanks!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also other people are stating that we can add the top left corner (P,P) &#43; bottom right corner values (NP,NP) and then divide by 2. However, I don&#39;t believe those values are the same.</p>

Using your classifier in HW4: Becoming a Requester,"<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p></p>
<p>We&#39;ve had a chance to look through submissions for HW3 and while it&#39;ll be a few days before grades are ready to be sent out, we wanted to offer some feedback and clarification. Most of you had really high accuracies and many of you noted that accuracy was &#34;higher&#34; when you eliminated cross-validation because of overfitting (in the same way scores are higher when the midterm matches the practice test very closely). </p>
<p></p>
<p>X represented the full set of articles. y represented the labels. There were hundreds of thousands of unigram features, because features corresponded to each word that appeared (repeats did not contribute to # of features -- see &#39;that guy shot that other guy&#39; for an example). </p>
<p></p>
<p>This week, you are re-training your classifier on the full set of articles that we gave you last week (&#39;articles&#39; is the name of the text file) and then output predictions on the new URLs you collected. You&#39;ll want to modify the code for your statistical classifier to generate the labels for crowdworkers to check - the file on the assignment page is a great start towards that. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have any questions, please come to office hours sooner rather than later and post to Piazza if your question hasn&#39;t already been asked. Some parts of this assignment just take time to finish -- crawling, waiting for crowd worker judgements, the questionnaire -- and it&#39;s better to leave yourself time to debug. </p>"

<p>There were two common points of confusion. Please feel free to ask questions here or in OHs if you are having trouble with these concepts, since they are important if you intend to do more ML in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What exactly are X and y? What are their dimensions? </strong></p>
<p>In short, y is a vector of labels (one label per article). X is a matrix of features (one row per article, one column per feature). (You might prefer to think of X as a list of vectors of features). A key point is that <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">every article has a value for every feature</span>-- so every article (row) has the same number of features (columns) associated with it. What changes are the values of those features (e.g. 0 or 1 in our assignment). Since the &#34;features&#34; in our case were words, <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">the number of features (number of columns of X) is equal to the number of words in our vocabulary</span> (this was probably ~300,000-500,000 in our dataset, depending on your preprocessing). If the word appeared in the article, the value for the word is 1 for that article, and if it did not appear, the value is 0. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You are not alone if you find this concept a bit abstract. The biggest hurdle to overcome when learning about ML is getting comfortable thinking about your data as a feature matrix. Once you have internalized this notion, the rest of ML is reasonably straightforward. Please, ask us questions!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>False positives and false negatives </strong></p>
<p>Many of you were confused by the concept of false positives and false negatives. <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">A *false positive* in our case is an article that should have been labeled &#34;not gun related&#34; (0) but was falsely labeled &#34;gun related&#34; (1).</span> These were likely articles with words like &#34;shoot&#34; but which referred to sports or movies instead of violent crimes. A *false negative* is an article that should have been labeled &#34;gun related&#34; (1) but was falsely labeled &#34;not gun related&#34; (0). Its good to think about these different types of errors when you are working on prediction tasks-- often different types of errors have different costs, or one type of error is worse than another.  (E.g. in medicine, tests that produce many false negatives are usually considered worse that ones that produce false positives. I&#39;m sure you can think of some reasons why?)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>But what now? My life has been so empty since turning in that classifier assignment... </strong></p>
<p>Many of you have expressed interest in learning more about machine learning, and you should absolutely consider enrolling in <a href=""https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~cis520/wiki/"" target=""_blank"">penn&#39;s ML course</a> or <a href=""http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis519/fall2015/"" target=""_blank"">penn&#39;s intro ML course</a>. Or check out the <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"" target=""_blank"">Coursera course</a> (crowdsourcing woot woot!). If you can&#39;t wait that long, you have all the freedom in the world to build an ML component into your final project, and we are more than happy to help you do so!</p>

(Writeup) Quality Control,"<p>A little confused; the write up says we are working with the data from assignment 5 (Becoming a Requester), which makes sense since it has the URLs and our predictions. However, it discusses workers and credibility - so I&#39;m assuming we&#39;re also using the .csv from CrowdFlower/MTurk when we had them classify the urls.<br /><br />Where I get confused is how we&#39;re expected to use this data. In the Majority Vote and Weighted Majority Vote sections, do we write a python script to process the .csv (??) to get info from each relevant column for each section, and output a file? Is there some kind of recommended method, since it&#39;s not all that clear from the write up?</p>"

Late submissions and turnin,"<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of you had trouble with turnin for the bootcamp, and sent us email submissions. As a general policy, we cannot accept submissions via email. For this assignment, we will not penalize late submissions, so if you have not yet submitted via turnin, or you are still having trouble using scp/ssh, reach out to us and let&#39;s get it figured out. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For future assignments, we will only consider an assignment to be submitted if it is submitted via turnin before the deadline. Keep in mind our late-day policy: you are allowed 5 total late days during the semester with no penalty. After that, we deduct one point per day late.</p>

Using Office Hours and Piazza,"<p>Hey All,</p>
<p></p>
<p>So there have been a lot of questions on Piazza regarding errors and incompatibility issues. I&#39;ve outlined a few suggestions below to make your life easier with regards getting through them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Using Piazza.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Remotely debugging system issues are pretty challenging. To ensure that we can get an answer to you faster - please specify (a) The System you&#39;re using (Mac, Windows, Linux etc.) and how many bits (b) Which installer you used (Pip vs. Conda) (c) If you&#39;re running the VM or not. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. Search through Piazza</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>More often than not the answer is already there on Piazza. Try and look through previous questions (especially ones endorsed by an instructor) to see if that solves your problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Using Stack Overflow</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The best way to learn cool things and debug issues is to use the power of Crowdsourcing! Stack Overflow will definitely have the answer to your questions. As you take more advanced classes you&#39;ll need StackOverflow to try and debug more complicated issues so it will be super useful to get a head start right now. If you&#39;re ever in doubt of what StackOverflow is asking you to do - feel free to post the link and ask on Piazza.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4. Using the VM</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes it makes more sense to just use a different platform which is pre-configured instead of trying to figure out why it doesn&#39;t work on your system. So I&#39;d suggest to everyone to use the VM. It&#39;s also super useful to get a hang of Linux (it&#39;s a rite of passage of sorts for any CS student). </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5. Office Hours</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Chances are if the above 3 haven&#39;t helped, Office Hours are the place to go. There are plenty spread throughout the week and more often than not you&#39;ll have at least one friendly NETS 213 TA hanging around Engineering - So swing by Office hours! </p>

Student Ownership of Final Project?,"<p>For the NETS 213 final project, do we as students retain ownership of our projects? I know that some schools will hold the ownership rights, and just wanted some clarification on this policy for the NETS 213 course.</p>"
Find a team during Wednesday&#39;s class,"<p>We are going to use Wednesday&#39;s NETS 213 class period to form teams for the final projects.  If you do not yet have a team, or if your team has fewer than 3 team members, then you are required to attend tomorrow&#39;s class and form a team.  If your team only has 3 members then you&#39;re encouraged to go and see if you can pick up 1 or 2 new teammates. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m traveling for a DARPA PI meeting, so the TAs will run the session.  You&#39;ll be asked to introduce yourselves (names, degree, year, etc), and say one project idea that you have (since the first team assignment is to brainstorm 3 ideas).  You should pair up with people by the end of class.  Don&#39;t leave without joining a team. </p>

HW3 Score Issue,"<p>I am confused about my score on the training the classifier hw3 assignment. The results say that I did not submit code?

Grabbing page contents -- question about my approach!,"<p>I&#39;ve successfully gotten my bing_api.py to grab URLS using the Bing API.  I am now working on grabbing the contents of each URL page so I can get the three fields to print out, as we&#39;re asked to do.  I modified the get_urls() function so that it returns a list of URLS. Then I created another function get_fields, which takes as input a list. So for each element in the list, I am using Beautiful Soup to get the three fields from it&#39;s HTML contents.  A few minor questions....</p>
<p></p>
<p>Does it make the most sense to have the get_fields() function take as input a single URL, and then in the main method, I can simply iterate over my list returned from the get_urls() function and for each URL get the fields I want, or simply pass the entire list to the get_fields() function and then grab all of the fields for all URLS. In the past, when I&#39;ve worked with BeautifulSoup, I&#39;ve stored all of the HTML contents locally, but is that a bad design choice, considering the URL list could be really, really big. I&#39;m trying to think about whether one approach is more efficient, or if it&#39;s a trivial design choice that does not really matter.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Overall, you did very well with it and are now masters of crawling the internet. You gained some new tools that you should keep in mind for the final project (and the first part has been released, yay!). </p>
<p></p>
<p>We did see a few common misconceptions that we&#39;d like to clear up. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>The <strong>hourly wage</strong> referred to what the workers completing your job earned (you can view this value on Crowdflower&#39;s analytics tab). Without simply paying more per task, the other variable we could affect was the amount of time it takes to complete. Making the links clickable, scraping the text of the article and uploading that to Crowdflower instead of URLs, and providing clear, unambiguous directions to make deciding the label easier were all great ways, but there&#39;s a lot that we can do on this side. </li><li><strong>Precision</strong> is the ratio of true positives over all positives, or the probability that once your classifier has labeled an article as gun violence, it&#39;s actually about an instance of gun violence. This differed from <strong>accuracy</strong> because accuracy is the ratio of correct labels over all labels (true positives &#43; true negatives)/(all positives &#43; all negatives). Some of you submitted definitions from other fields, and we would encourage you to go back through and review the slides. </li><li><strong>Recall</strong> is the ratio of (true positives)/(true positives &#43; false negatives). For our data set, this was the probability that an article about gun violence would be given a positive label by our classifier. We couldn&#39;t calculate that because we only gave the Crowdflower workers positively-labeled data, and therefore can&#39;t draw any conclusions about the number of false negatives in our labels. </li><li>Within the <strong>Bing API</strong> piece, many of the titles submitted were &#34;News Result.&#34; This is a field in the Bing API, but doesn&#39;t correspond to the actual title of the article (or it would be very difficult to decide which articles to read). </li><li>There are a lot of sources of <strong>bias</strong> in the way that we collected data. One of our goals is to minimize this. It&#39;s easy to see that minor injuries are unlikely to be reported, that areas with less media coverage are less likely to be scraped (some of you started with the New York Times and the LA Times, but nobody checked any newspapers from the middle of nowhere), that reporting around gun violence can be sensationalized and since we aren&#39;t deduplicating results yet, there are likely repeat incidents that were reported on at multiple URLs you submitted. There are other sources too, and thinking about this is an important part of building a comprehensive system to measure anything (not just gun violence). </li><li>Some of you got really original with what you named the files that you submitted. While we appreciate your creative genius, it makes it a lot easier to grade when the names of files approximately correspond to what&#39;s in them. Please keep this in mind for future assignments. </li></ul>

<p>If you have a regrade request or specific questions about your grades, you should come to office hours to discuss it. </p>

<p>2. How do we handle the subset of our data that is considered gold (the quality control questions). Do we automatically label them correctly or should we still go by the majority (which could theoretically be wrong) or should we not use that subset of data at all?</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting a &#39;nan&#39; Tau value for some strange reason when I&#39;m comparing against CrowdFlower data. I just wanted to know if I&#39;m doing something wrong here that can be fixed since the above code should work to only use the qualities of workers that are in both data sets.</p>

Majority,"When my partner and I posted the job in assignment 5, it seems that we only had each URL judged twice. For majority vote, how should we decide which decision is the majority if there are only two votes and they&#39;re split?

Unclear what data we&#39;re supposed to use for weighted majority/majority computations.,"<p>I get that we want to compute &#34;weighted majority&#34; on the workers and data (these being &#39;modes&#39; in the bare bones code which then call the print_qualities and print_labels functions accordingly. So I want to just do the weighted majority/majority computations within both of those functions. But I have three files: aggregated, full, and contributed - I am confused which files I&#39;m supposed to be using. Because &#39;worker&#39; mode calls print_qualities. But the workset (contributed) doesn&#39;t have a &#39;labels&#39; field so how would we compute weighted majority vote and print the url/label?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, one of the TA&#39;s kindly described the 6 files we want to output (bold text copied below)<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>As discussed in lecture, </strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>3 files containing labels for each url, one file for each algorithm (majority, weighted, and CrowdFlower)</strong>
<ul><li><strong>url &#43; label calculated by simple majority vote  </strong><em> &lt;- what files do we use to do this?</em></li><li><strong>url &#43; label calculated by weighted vote </strong><em>&lt;- what files do we use to do this?</em></li><li><strong>url &#43; label as determined by Crowdflower (copy &#43; paste from aggregated report so you can compare via Cohen&#39;s kappa and Kendell Tau correlation)</strong></li></ul>
</li><li><strong>3 files containing qualities for each worker, one file for each algorithm (majority, weighted, and CrowdFlower)</strong>
<ul><li><strong>worker &#43; quality calculated by majority vote (% of time they agree with majority vote)</strong> <em>&lt;- what files do we use to do this?</em></li><li><strong>worker &#43; quality calculated by weighted vote (% of time they agree with weighted vote) </strong><em>&lt;- what files do we use to do this?</em></li><li><strong>worker &#43; quality as determined by Crowdflower (again, you don&#39;t generate this, but you need it to make comparisons for part 2)</strong></li></ul>

Error when running classifier template,<p>Resolved!</p>
Number of articles and urls is significantly lesser than urls,"I had about 3200 urls when I ran the get_clean_text.py on the biglab machines, but when I counted the number of lines of the file obtained after running BeautifulSoup, I only have 1379 lines (i.e articles and urls). Is this normal, or should I scrape the urls again? I believe a lot of urls&#39; articles didn&#39;t get scraped because of exception handling in get_clean_text.py"
Workers and uniqueness,"<p>I differentiate between workers using the &#39;_id&#39; field of the CSV file, which I assume is the worker id.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, the issue is that each row has a unique &#39;_id&#39;. In other words, every worker did exactly 1 URL. I ran my program, and each worker has a quality of either 1 or 0, which confirms this. This doesn&#39;t seem quite right. If this is true, wouldn&#39;t the part about golden URLs be unfeasible, since if someone did a golden URL, and we calculated a quality based off that, we can&#39;t use it for  any of the other URLs, since each worker did only 1 URL at most.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do I have a misconception about the structure of the csv file, or is this actually the case? If it is, is it acceptable?</p>"
Having trouble getting your grades via email?,"<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p></p>
<p>We want to ensure that you&#39;re getting the grade emails for all the work you&#39;ve submitted. We have released grades for the first three assignments (Becoming a Crowdworker, Market Research Questionnaire, Training a Classifier). Participation points and other assignments haven&#39;t been scored yet, so you haven&#39;t missed any emails there. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you&#39;re missing score reports, do the following: </p>
<p>1. Check your spam folder. </p>
<p>2. Add <a href=""mailto:katmill&#64;seas.upenn.edu"">katmill&#64;seas.upenn.edu</a> to your contacts so that emails don&#39;t get caught in your spam filter in the future (the entire course staff collaborates on grades, but the emails come from my account). </p>
<p>3. Fill out the Google form here: <a href=""http://goo.gl/forms/VSBGjdHM1c"">http://goo.gl/forms/VSBGjdHM1c</a> and I will forward you the score reports of the assignments that you missed. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have specific questions about how something was graded, post privately to Piazza or come to one of the TA&#39;s office hours. Note that the drop deadline is on Friday, and if you&#39;re concerned about how you&#39;re doing in the class, you should come talk to one of us. </p>
<p></p>"
Take-aways from your company profiles,"<p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have finished grading your company profiles, and I wanted to highlight some common misunderstandings (if that is the right word) that cropped up in many of your assignments. As we go forward in the class, and especially as you all begin to think about your final projects, make sure you are keeping a very open mind of what constitutes &#34;crowdsourcing.&#34; Don&#39;t get too stuck in the Mechanical Turk/Crowdflower/micro-tasking mindset. </p>
<p></p>
<p>1.<strong> Users vs. Contributors</strong>-- Many of you seemed confused about what constitutes a user vs. a contributor. In many crowdsourcing companies, this line is blurry- or nonexistent! Many companies you looked at fit what can be thought of as a <strong>&#34;data-mining&#34; model (e.g. Yelp, Foursquare)</strong>, in which the primary service being provided depends on using data and modeling observed patterns of behavior-- e.g. to target ads or to recommend products. In these cases, <strong>the users are the contributors</strong>-- everyone who participates provides data, and everyone uses everyone else&#39;s data. This is an awesome crowdsourcing model because it is (ideally) self-sustaining and self-incentivizing. The more a person contributes (by providing more data about themselves), the better product they receive (e.g. better recommendations). </p>
<p></p>
<p>2. <strong>Aggregation</strong>-- Many of the companies we look at fit into the &#34;match-making&#34; or<strong> &#34;marketplace&#34; model (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, Etsy)</strong>. This is a very common case in which the company is simply working to match supply with demand, where the suppliers (e.g. drivers, in the case of Uber) and the consumers (riders) are distributed all over, and may have trouble finding one another otherwise. Here, rating systems etc. are one piece of the platform that might require aggregating, but arguably the more interesting aggregation problem is <strong>how to match a supplier with a consumer</strong>. Is this through preference-based recommendation systems (as in the data-mining model discussed above), through location-based matching, through bidding/price? Making these matches is non-trival, but crucial to making the company function.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. <strong>Does this update a previous service or business model, or is it completely new?</strong> For this question, more than a third of you said &#34;completely new.&#34; Try to think broadly when you are considering where these crowdsourcing companies fit into the economy as a whole. (Think Silicon Valley&#39;s favorite buzzword: &#34;disruption.&#34;) Most of these services being provided are not completely new, but they are directly competing with a service that was traditionally supplied by a brick-and-mortar company in a more centralized manner. Uber competes with taxi companies, Airbnb with hotel chains, Coursera with higher education universities. This is part of what makes crowdsourcing so exciting! </p>
<p></p>
<p>4. (Not a major conceptual flaw, but speaks to the tech market today.) Getting venture capital funding is <strong>not</strong> a business model. (Smart) investors don&#39;t invest in a company who says their plan for generating revenue is to &#34;get money from investors.&#34; When in doubt about the company&#39;s business plan, it is probably &#34;ads&#34;. :-)  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Feel free do ask questions! Few of these concepts are clearly defined, and there are lots of ways to think about any one company. The main thing is to keep an open, creative perspective when thinking about <strong>how crowds can solve problems, and what technology can enable them to do so</strong>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Have a great weekend everyone!</p>

"Text sentiment analysis gone awry, featuring my high school","<p>A High School Is Actually Not Manhattan’s Saddest Spot, a Researcher Says <a href=""http://nyti.ms/165bok9"" target=""_blank"">http://nyti.ms/165bok9</a> via &#64;nytmetro</p>

Definition of Gun Violence,"<p>I am creating my cloudflower task and want to give the most descriptive definition of gun violence as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are we only interested in articles that mention a specific act of gun violence? For example how should we classify articles that discuss gun violence statistics or gun crime as a whole.</p>
<p>If a gun was involved in the article but no one was injured, should this be considered gun violence?</p>"
Worker IDs excluded in Full Crowdflower Report Included From Contributors,"<p>My teammate and I are finding that some of the workerIDs which are included in the Contributors report are excluded from the Full report.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first we thought it had to do with trust value, as the Contributors report includes workers with a trust_overall value of 0 and the Full report doesn&#39;t, but the Full report is also missing some workers with trust values above 0.6. For example, the both reports contain a worker with a trust value of 0.625, but the Full is missing a worker with a trust value of 0.6364. We&#39;re not sure why else some workers appear to be arbitrarily excluded from Full.</p>

EM iteration beginning,"<p>Hi, I&#39;ve looked at &#64;362 but the answer doesn&#39;t help too much. I&#39;m wondering if we are supposed to round the percentages we compute at the beginning. That is, once we have determined the new guesses (slide 88 left side). Are we supposed to convert them to 1s and 0s before moving on to determine worker accuracy as we did in the beginning or are we supposed to leave them as is (such as in the slides: 26% vs 74%, 69% vs 31%, etc.) </p>
<p></p>
<p>If we are supposed to leave them as is, how are the two values distributed between workers when we evaluate their truth tables? Would it be incrementally? That is from the slides, W1s first guess was Porn so he would be 74% wrong and 26% right? Additionally, are we to add to his original truth table (that is his value would sum from his original:</p>
<p></p>
<p>2 0</p>
<p>2 1</p>

Submitting assignments via turnin,"<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For your python bootcamp, and for many other assignments this semester, you will be using &#39;turnin&#39;, which is a program on eniac. This requires using the &#39;ssh&#39; and &#39;scp&#39; commands from your terminal. Instructions on how to do this are below, but please come to office hours if this whole process looks foreign to you. It will take about 30 seconds to show you in person, versus much longer than 30 seconds of playing guess-and-check on your own. :) </p>
<p></p>
<p>You will be turning in your entire iPython notebook. Once you have your notebook copied over to the eniac machines and sshed yourself over to the eniac machines (instructions below), you will run.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>turnin -c nets213 -p python-bootcamp -v IPythonBootcamp.ipynb</pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is the process, from the beginning. The lines beginning with &#39;$&#39; or &#39;~&gt;&#39; are things you will need to type. Lines beginning with &#39;#&#39; are comments, explaining the commands below. Lines that have no special characters at the show the output you should expect to see.</p>
<p></p>
<pre>#Copy your iPython file (which right now is on your computer) to your account on the eniac. You can do this using the &#39;scp&#39; or &#39;secure copy&#39; command, like below.
$ scp IPythonBootcamp.ipynb epavlick&#64;eniac.seas.upenn.edu:               
epavlick&#64;eniac.seas.upenn.edu&#39;s password: 
IPythonBootcamp.ipynb           

#Log on to the  eniac machines (using your usual penn username/password). You should see your command prompt change to say something like &#64;plus or &#64;minus, like below.
$ ssh epavlick&#64;eniac.seas.upenn.edu

Last login: Wed Jan 27 14:46:24 2016 from 10.251.134.177
epavlick&#64;plus:~&gt; 

#Make sure your file was copied over successfully. You can check by listing the contents of the current directory using the &#39;ls&#39; command. Hopefully you will see many things listed, and your IPython file should be one of them.
epavlick&#64;plus:~&gt; ls

#You can keep things organized by making a new folder for this assignment using the &#34;mkdir&#34; command, and moving your file into it using the &#34;mv&#34; command. See below.

<p>then it will show this text during the preview of the job (before they accept). How can I control it so that the JS function only runs after they accept the job?</p>

extract_text.py - how should the text look?,"<p>I think I did the extract_text portion correctly, but I have a couple questions just to be sure, because the output is a little strange: </p>

<p>1) 5 of the 100 links gave Errors and were not outputted, so my text file only has 95 urls. Is that fine? </p>
<p></p>
<p>2) Should the text portions be surrounded by &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; tags? All of them are, which I assume is what we want, but some text does not look useful at all (e.g., the text for &#34;http://segazine.com/police-say-shooting-near-city-market-injured-5-not-3/&#34; is simply &lt;p&gt;Savannah&lt;/p&gt;)</p>

scipy.stats.kendalltau returing nan as results,"<p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m having trouble with scipy.stats.kendalltau function here.</p>
<p>It does return valid float values when I compare majority vote result and crowdflower result.</p>
<p>However, whenever weighted vote result is involved, it returns nan for both tau and p-value.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My weighted vote result for worker quality is actually 1.0 for all the workers. This seemed to cause nan return value since as soon as I modify one of the values to be non-1.0, the function returns float values.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Could I answer as nan for the questionnaire in this case?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks</p>"
Homework 2 Report Question,"<p></p><div>In my score report for the market research questionnaire (homework 2), it says I received -1 for &#34;saying that Uber was a completely new business model. It updates the taxi business model.&#34;  </div>

Homework 3 Grade,"<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I worked with Alex Sands on assignment 3, and we just received our grade. We lost a point because: &#34;-1 Didn&#39;t correctly identify a misclassified article.&#34; We type all of our answers to the questions in a separate Google Doc, so we have the text of the article that was misclassified. It is below:</p>

<p>We must have submitted this in the form because it is a required question. I was hoping to get some feedback on why we missed this point. As far as I can tell, this article seems to be misclassified, so we are uncertain on why we missed this point. We would appreciate any feedback!</p>

A bit frustrated...,"<p>Hi, I didn&#39;t want to post this publicly but I&#39;m honestly a bit frustrated about this homework assignment since my partner and I have worked over 10 hours on it at this point just figuring out random python errors that have been happening and haven&#39;t even gotten to the crowdsourcing portion of the assignment. The majority of the time we&#39;ve spent have been either fixing errors in the initial code skeleton or dealing with things like the xpath, which I didn&#39;t feel like was well-explained in either the homework page, in class, or on Piazza. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I think also that I&#39;m frustrated in general because I&#39;m also OCR-ing at the current moment as well as taking four other courses, each with a substantial time investment. I&#39;ve taken other project courses such as CIS 350 and I think that the scope of the weekly homework assignments so far have much more time consuming than the semester-long projects in that and other classes, which doesn&#39;t make sense to me given that the description for NETS 213 says that students of any major who have taken CIS 120 can take this class, and I definitely don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry if this makes me sound petulant; it&#39;s very late right now and I am still waiting for our program to extract all the text from the articles, and my partner and I started on Sunday, since I couldn&#39;t start earlier due to being off campus for OCR. I understand we have late days, but I also feel that even given my comp sci background, this homework was far more substantial than could have been completed in a week for people with little to no Python experience, and taking other classes as well. </p>"

<p>if &#34;word2&#34; in text : decision = 1</p>
<p>... (rest of decision = 1 words)</p>
<p>if &#34;word10&#34; in text : decision = 0</p>
<p>if &#34;word11&#34; in text : decision = 0</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am still a bit confused about how a decision tree would work for this when the conditions are not interrelated</p>

<p>Would the tree look like this?</p>

Accuracy of Training Data,"<p>To my understanding, the training data says that</p>
<pre>according to afp on thursday, the judge of the high-profile george zimmerman case, who was accused of shooting 17-year-old trayvon martin, ruled that the jury can consider the lesser charge of manslaughter when deliberating. the lesser charge of manslaughter against mr. zimmerman will be considered in addition to the second-degree murder charge he is facing. for mr. zimmerman to be convicted of second-degree murder, the jury must determine that he acted with spite, malice or ill will without regard for human life in the shooting death last year of trayvon martin. manslaughter has a lower threshold for prosecutors to prove and is defined in florida as the unlawful killing of a human being without malice including the result of an accident or other act in which the person does not have the mental state to commit a murder. closing arguments are underway today, july 11th. trayvon martin is dead because george zimmerman &#34;tracked&#34; and then shot trayvon martin instead of waiting for police to arrive, prosecutor bernie de la rionda told the jury at zimmerman&#39;s murder trial. de la rionda, presenting the prosecution&#39;s closing argument, accused zimmerman of taking the law into his own hands during their february 2012 confrontation. the defense team, scheduled to close friday, has maintained that trayvon, 17, was the aggressor and that zimmerman, 29, shot him in self-defense. like what youve read? subscribe to receive (spam free) email notifications for top news articles. emily sutherlin is also the pregnancy examiner. got something to say? say it on examiner by following this link to sign up.</pre>

Crowdflower data,"<p>Our crowdflower aggregated data shows that every single URL in our job was NOT about gun violence.

Blurry Text Recognition - Clarification on Parallel Process,"<p>For the blurry text recognition example we went over in class, which is in one of the 5 research papers, how exactly does the parallel process work? Does every worker literally start from scratch and try to fill in the words? </p>
<p></p>
<p>The paper mentions that &#34;multiple turkers deciphered this entire passage almost perfectly in the parallel process.&#34; When I try to decipher the passages, I feel like I&#39;d be lucky if I can even get 1 out of 30 words correct.

HW 6 - Replicate Science Grade,"<p>Hello, </p>
<p></p>
<p>We received 4.5/5 points for my Replicate Science homework. These were the comments: &#34;Great work. The only deduction in points was for not representing your results in the same style as the original paper - in this case, creating the tables/graphs used by the authors (0.5 points).&#34; </p>

<p>We picked the &#34;Financial Incentives and the Performance of Crowds&#34; paper, which is out of 6 points, so I was wondering why we didn&#39;t receive 5.5/5 points instead. </p>

Confusion aboutd deliverables,"<p>The third and fourth items in the list of deliverables are </p>

<p></p>
<p>However, in the actual directions, <tt>gun_archive_urls.txt</tt> is gerated in step 1, <tt>bing_api_results.txt</tt> is generated in step 4, and<tt> articles_and_urls.tx</tt>t is generated in step 7.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are the filenames listed in the deliverables correct, or the step numbers?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, the Gun Violence Archive website seems to limit results to the past three days; I&#39;m assuming this means that we won&#39;t be graded on whether our list exactly matches one generated by the professor or TAs?</p>

Coloring the Text Blue and Yellow,"<p>RESOLVED!: I realized I had to edit the span tags from the code rather than in the CML editor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was not clear to me in the instructions if making the cities and persons colored in the text is optional or not, but I still don&#39;t understand how to implement this part even though we added the span tags to our clean_text because when using the cml editor, we can&#39;t access all of the cities or people to add the color tag in the CML editor.
