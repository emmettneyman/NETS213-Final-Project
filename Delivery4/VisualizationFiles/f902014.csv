We've assembled this rundown of tips you may discover helpful as you begin: 1. Make inquiries! The most ideal approach to get answers is to make inquiries! Make inquiries on Piazza instead of messaging your showing staff so everybody can profit by the reaction (thus you can get answers from schoolmates who are up as late as you seem to be). 2. Alter inquiries and answers wiki-style. Consider Piazza a Q&A wiki for your class. Each inquiry has only a solitary understudies' answer that understudies can alter all things considered (and a solitary educators answer for teachers). 3. Add a followup to remark or ask further inquiries. To remark on or get some information about a post, begin a followup exchange. Mark it determined when the issue has been tended to, and include any significant data once again into the Q&A above. 4. Go unknown. Modest? Forget about it. You can simply select to post or alter secretly. 5. Tag your posts. It's significantly more helpful to discover all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are labeled. Sort a preceding a watchword to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the inquiry food to channel for all posts that share that tag. 6. Position code and comparisons. Including a code scrap? Click the pre or tt catch in the inquiry editorial manager to include pre-arranged or inline print content. Numerical comparison? Click the Fx catch to get to the LaTeX supervisor to fabricate a pleasantly arranged comparison. 7. See and download class points of interest and assets. Click the Course Page catch in your top bar to get to the class syllabus, staff contact data, available time points of interest, and course assets all in one spot! Contact the Piazza Team whenever with inquiries or remarks at team@piazza.com. We adore input!","Piazza is a Q&A stage intended to get you incredible answers from colleagues and educators quick.

<p></p>
<p>So there have been a lot of questions on Piazza regarding errors and incompatibility issues. I&#39;ve outlined a few suggestions below to make your life easier with regards getting through them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Using Piazza.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Remotely debugging system issues are pretty challenging. To ensure that we can get an answer to you faster - please specify (a) The System you&#39;re using (Mac, Windows, Linux etc.) and how many bits (b) Which installer you used (Pip vs. Conda) (c) If you&#39;re running the VM or not. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. Search through Piazza</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>More often than not the answer is already there on Piazza. Try and look through previous questions (especially ones endorsed by an instructor) to see if that solves your problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Using Stack Overflow</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The best way to learn cool things and debug issues is to use the power of Crowdsourcing! Stack Overflow will definitely have the answer to your questions. As you take more advanced classes you&#39;ll need StackOverflow to try and debug more complicated issues so it will be super useful to get a head start right now. If you&#39;re ever in doubt of what StackOverflow is asking you to do - feel free to post the link and ask on Piazza.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4. Using the VM</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes it makes more sense to just use a different platform which is pre-configured instead of trying to figure out why it doesn&#39;t work on your system. So I&#39;d suggest to everyone to use the VM. It&#39;s also super useful to get a hang of Linux (it&#39;s a rite of passage of sorts for any CS student). </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5. Office Hours</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Chances are if the above 3 haven&#39;t helped, Office Hours are the place to go. There are plenty spread throughout the week and more often than not you&#39;ll have at least one friendly NETS 213 TA hanging around Engineering - So swing by Office hours! </p>

<p>You should have just received your assignments for peer reviewing project pitches. You will be reviewing the ideas from two teams (3 ideas per team) and filling out the form <a href=""http://goo.gl/forms/JaChvLRd0x"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. The deadline is next Friday, March 25th, before lecture - it&#39;s critical that you submit your feedback prior to then so that we can turn it around and give you ample time to select or modify your idea before starting implementation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you didn&#39;t receive an email, the details are unclear or incorrect, or there are any other problems, let us know as soon as possible. </p>

<p></p>
<p>I just started watching pitches, and realized that I got 5 pitches to grade,</p>
<p>while the google doc seemed to be designed for 3 pitches.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>",Peer review for this Friday,"<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p></p>
<p>We&#39;ve sent the feedback from your peers on the final project pitches. If you didn&#39;t receive it, first check with your group (if your Penn email is a personal email account, like on gmail, it may not have matched your PennKey to it), then let us know if nobody in your group received any emails. You should have received at least one email - each email corresponds to one person&#39;s review of your three projects. If you have any questions, please let us know. </p>
