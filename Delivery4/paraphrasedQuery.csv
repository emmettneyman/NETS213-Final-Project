Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:

1.  <b>Ask questions!</b>

The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).

2.  <b>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</b>

Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <b>students' answer</b> that students can edit collectively (and a single <b>instructors   answer</b> for instructors).

3.  <b>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</b>

To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <b>followup discussion</b>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.

4.  <b>Go anonymous.</b>

Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.

5.  <b>Tag your posts.</b>

It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.

6.  <b>Format code and equations.</b>

Adding a code snippet? Click the <b>pre</b> or <b>tt</b> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. 
Mathematical equation? Click the <b>Fx</b> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.

7.  <b>View and download class details and resources.</b>

Click the <b>Course Page</b> button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources  all in one place!


Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at <b>team@piazza.com</b>. We love feedback!","Piazza is a Q&A stage intended to get you incredible answers from colleagues and educators quick. We've assembled this rundown of tips you may discover helpful as you begin: 1. Make inquiries! The most ideal approach to get answers is to make inquiries! Make inquiries on Piazza instead of messaging your showing staff so everybody can profit by the reaction (thus you can get answers from schoolmates who are up as late as you seem to be). 2. Alter inquiries and answers wiki-style. Consider Piazza a Q&A wiki for your class. Each inquiry has only a solitary understudies' answer that understudies can alter all things considered (and a solitary educators answer for teachers). 3. Add a followup to remark or ask further inquiries. To remark on or get some information about a post, begin a followup exchange. Mark it determined when the issue has been tended to, and include any significant data once again into the Q&A above. 4. Go unknown. Modest? Forget about it. You can simply select to post or alter secretly. 5. Tag your posts. It's significantly more helpful to discover all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are labeled. Sort a preceding a watchword to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the inquiry food to channel for all posts that share that tag. 6. Position code and comparisons. Including a code scrap? Click the pre or tt catch in the inquiry editorial manager to include pre-arranged or inline print content. Numerical comparison? Click the Fx catch to get to the LaTeX supervisor to fabricate a pleasantly arranged comparison. 7. See and download class points of interest and assets. Click the Course Page catch in your top bar to get to the class syllabus, staff contact data, available time points of interest, and course assets all in one spot!

So for the  <a href=""http://axon.cs.byu.edu/ICCC2015proceedings/4.1Harmon.pdf"">study</a>  she presented at this year  s International Conference on Computational Creativity, Harmon restricted her program to simple sentences that fit certain patterns.

<p></p>
<p>Each person read sets of five FIGURE8 sentences at a time. People ranked the similes for their clarity, as well as how enjoyable they were to read. Harmon then compared those ratings to scores the computer program had given itself for clarity and overall quality. Harmon found that her subjects   ratings were pretty close to how FIGURE8 rated itself. For example, humans and computer agreed that  <em>The queen stands like a strong castle</em>  was a good, clear simile. But they also agreed that  <em>It was her pearl, crumpling like a drowned corpse  </em>didn  t make much sense."";</p>","Here's a cool case of the connection amongst crowdsourcing and machine learning, connected to verse:

Harmon found that her subjects appraisals were quite near how FIGURE8 evaluated itself. For instance, people and PC concurred that The ruler stands like a solid manor was a decent, clear metaphor.
