        "content": "\nPiazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:\n\n1.  <b>Ask questions!</b>\n\nThe best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).\n\n2.  <b>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</b>\n\nThink of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <b>students' answer</b> that students can edit collectively (and a single <b>instructors\u2019 answer</b> for instructors).\n\n3.  <b>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</b>\n\nTo comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <b>followup discussion</b>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.\n\n4.  <b>Go anonymous.</b>\n\nShy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.\n\n5.  <b>Tag your posts.</b>\n\nIt's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a \u201c#\u201d before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.\n\n6.  <b>Format code and equations.</b>\n\nAdding a code snippet? Click the <b>pre</b> or <b>tt</b> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. \nMathematical equation? Click the <b>Fx</b> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.\n\n7.  <b>View and download class details and resources.</b>\n\nClick the <b>Course Page</b> button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources\u2014all in one place!\n\n\nContact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at <b>team@piazza.com</b>. We love feedback!",

From combatting terrorism to safeguarding the future of the planet, society will confront unprecedented challenges over the next decades. To succeed, Noveck argues, we have to run our institutions differently. Getting ideas from outside - often called crowdsourcing or open innovation - should be just as vital for the improvement of public institutions as it has been for success in commerce and science. Data science tools hold the potential to transform how we govern by making it possible to solve hard problems through the diverse and distributed expertise of the many citizens who would be willing to contribute their talents, skills, expertise and enthusiasm to the public good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Excerpt: &#34;Changing how we make decisions will depend squarely on having the personnel who embrace openness and collaboration. The recognition of citizen expertise does not mean jettisoning the professionals and substituting some kind of web-based plebiscite-far from it. Making good use of citizen expertise will require even better-trained managers and leaders. This new breed of professional-if we can call it that with a wink and a nod-will need to know how to work and talk and decide with citizens rather than for them. Just as the next generation will need to know how to govern with big and open data, predictive analytics, and real-time indicators, they will also need to develop the skillset for managing the conversation to get at the intelligence necessary to govern in a complex society.&#34; - From\u00a0<em>Smart Citizens, Smarter State</em></p>",

Computing such statuses for a single user takes about 15 minutes, and since there were a lot of new users, it takes a while to work through them.

I&#39;ve installed crowd worker, created an account on crowd flower and would love to be able to leave a review on Crowd Worker&#39;s page on the App store, but I simply can&#39;t move forward until I get this issue resolved. I think the issue is really intuitive (clearly I need more approval), but I was wondering how I should contact the professor about this issue, and if this is a valid reason for potentially turning in my homework late. I would love to complete the assignment under someone else&#39;s credentials (if that&#39;s possible) or do whatever else I can to get it done, I just can&#39;t under this account until this issue is clearly resolved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sorry for the panic tone, and thank you guys for your help. Please let\u00a0me know what my best course of action is, and thank you so much.</p>",

In a pilot study, people read FIGURE8\u2019s more complex sentences. But the task seemed to wear them out. \u201cIt became more of an English assignment,\u201d she\u00a0says. So for the\u00a0<a href=\"http://axon.cs.byu.edu/ICCC2015proceedings/4.1Harmon.pdf\">study</a>\u00a0she presented at this year\u2019s International Conference on Computational Creativity, Harmon restricted her program to simple sentences that fit certain patterns. It wasn\u2019t FIGURE8\u2019s most thrilling writing, but these shorter phrases would be easier for subjects to compare.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Each person read sets of five FIGURE8 sentences at a time. People ranked the similes for their clarity, as well as how enjoyable they were to read. Harmon then compared those ratings to scores the computer program had given itself for clarity and overall quality. Harmon found that her subjects\u2019 ratings were pretty close to how FIGURE8 rated itself. For example, humans and computer agreed that\u00a0<em>The queen stands like a strong castle</em>\u00a0was a good, clear simile. But they also agreed that\u00a0<em>It was her pearl, crumpling like a drowned corpse\u00a0</em>didn\u2019t make much sense.&#34;</p>",

I&#39;ve outlined a few suggestions below to make your life easier with regards getting through them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>1. Using Piazza.</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remotely debugging system issues are pretty challenging. To ensure that we can get an answer to you faster - please specify (a) The System you&#39;re using (Mac, Windows, Linux etc.) and how many bits (b) Which installer you used (Pip vs. Conda) (c) If you&#39;re running the VM or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>2. Search through Piazza</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>More often than not the answer is already there on Piazza. Try and look through previous questions (especially ones endorsed by an instructor) to see if that solves your problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>3. Using Stack Overflow</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The best way to learn cool things and debug issues is to use the power of Crowdsourcing! Stack Overflow will definitely have the answer to your questions. As you take more advanced classes you&#39;ll need StackOverflow to try and debug more complicated issues so it will be super useful to get a head start right now. If you&#39;re ever in doubt of what StackOverflow is asking you to do - feel free to post the link and ask on Piazza.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>4. Using the VM</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sometimes it makes more sense to just use a different platform which is pre-configured instead of trying to figure out why it doesn&#39;t work on your system. So I&#39;d suggest to everyone to use the VM. It&#39;s also super useful to get a hang of Linux (it&#39;s a rite of passage of sorts for any CS student).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>5. Office Hours</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Chances are if the above 3 haven&#39;t helped, Office Hours are the place to go. There are plenty spread throughout the week and more often than not you&#39;ll have at least one friendly NETS 213 TA hanging around Engineering - So swing by Office hours!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>#pin</p>\n<p></p>",

But keep in mind how the training data was collected. We crawled a blog to collect gun articles (you will repeat this process next week) and we sampled random articles as non-gun articles. Both of these steps are imperfect. This is a fact of life when you are trying to build ML models-- perfectly clean training data is expensive and time-consuming to build, whereas good-enough data is cheap (or free) and fast to get. So we often just go with the latter and pray our models are robust enough to deal with it (they usually are).\u00a0</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Everyone!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We have finished grading your company profiles, and I wanted to highlight some common misunderstandings (if that is the right word)\u00a0that cropped up in many of your assignments. As we go forward in the class, and especially as you all begin to think about your final projects, make sure you are keeping a very open mind of what constitutes &#34;crowdsourcing.&#34; Don&#39;t get too stuck in the Mechanical Turk/Crowdflower/micro-tasking mindset.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1.<strong> Users vs. Contributors</strong>-- Many of you seemed confused about what constitutes a user vs. a contributor. In many crowdsourcing companies, this line is blurry- or nonexistent! Many companies you looked at fit what can be thought of as a\u00a0<strong>&#34;data-mining&#34; model (e.g. Yelp, Foursquare)</strong>, in which the primary service being provided depends on using data and modeling observed patterns of behavior-- e.g. to target ads or to recommend products. In these cases, <strong>the users are the contributors</strong>-- everyone who participates provides data, and everyone uses everyone else&#39;s\u00a0data. This is an awesome crowdsourcing model because it is (ideally) self-sustaining and self-incentivizing. The more a person contributes (by providing more data about themselves), the better product they receive (e.g. better recommendations).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. <strong>Aggregation</strong>-- Many of the companies we look at fit into the &#34;match-making&#34; or<strong> &#34;marketplace&#34; model (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, Etsy)</strong>. This is a very common case in which the company is simply working to match supply with demand, where the suppliers (e.g. drivers, in the case of Uber) and the consumers (riders) are distributed all over,\u00a0and may have trouble finding one another otherwise. Here, rating systems etc. are one piece of the platform that might require aggregating, but arguably the more interesting aggregation\u00a0problem is <strong>how to match a supplier with a consumer</strong>. Is this through preference-based recommendation systems (as in\u00a0the data-mining model discussed above), through location-based matching, through bidding/price?

        "content": "<p>Hi Everyone!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We have finished grading your company profiles, and I wanted to highlight some common misunderstandings (if that is the right word)\u00a0that cropped up in many of your assignments. As we go forward in the class, and especially as you all begin to think about your final projects, make sure you are keeping a very open mind of what constitutes &#34;crowdsourcing.&#34; Don&#39;t get too stuck in the Mechanical Turk/Crowdflower/micro-tasking mindset.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1.<strong> Users vs. Contributors</strong>-- Many of you seemed confused about what constitutes a user vs. a contributor. In many crowdsourcing companies, this line is blurry- or nonexistent! Many companies you looked at fit what can be thought of as a\u00a0<strong>&#34;data-mining&#34; model (e.g. Yelp, Foursquare)</strong>, in which the primary service being provided depends on using data and modeling observed patterns of behavior-- e.g. to target ads or to recommend products. In these cases, <strong>the users are the contributors</strong>-- everyone who participates provides data, and everyone uses everyone else&#39;s\u00a0data. This is an awesome crowdsourcing model because it is (ideally) self-sustaining and self-incentivizing. The more a person contributes (by providing more data about themselves), the better product they receive (e.g. better recommendations).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. <strong>Aggregation</strong>-- Many of the companies we look at fit into the &#34;match-making&#34; or<strong> &#34;marketplace&#34; model (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, Etsy)</strong>. This is a very common case in which the company is simply working to match supply with demand, where the suppliers (e.g. drivers, in the case of Uber) and the consumers (riders) are distributed all over,\u00a0and may have trouble finding one another otherwise. Here, rating systems etc. are one piece of the platform that might require aggregating, but arguably the more interesting aggregation\u00a0problem is <strong>how to match a supplier with a consumer</strong>. Is this through preference-based recommendation systems (as in\u00a0the data-mining model discussed above), through location-based matching, through bidding/price? Making these matches is non-trival, but crucial to making the company function.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3.\u00a0<strong>Does this update a previous service or business model, or is it completely new?</strong>\u00a0For this question, more than a third of you said &#34;completely new.&#34; Try\u00a0to think broadly when you are considering where these crowdsourcing companies fit into the economy as a whole.

So what would happen if a bunch of geeks moved their families to a third world country and did a tech startup to fight poverty and change the world?&#34;<br /><br />Apparently some people went to Nepal with a simple mission to change the world with tech for all the humanitarian reasons, and so they agreed the crowdsourcing model is broken and they wanted to improve upon it.</td><td>Privately held company</td><td>The company provides the service of giving other companies a cloud-sourced workforce to scale up working, giving them a labor force that is closely monitored and regulated, so that it has all the benefits of cloud sourcing but is more fair and provides better more reliable results than standard crowdsourcing sites (such as MTurk)</td><td>Updates a previous model</td><td>It replaces the crowdsourcing model of sites like MTurk with a &#34;cloud labor&#34; model of a highly regulated and trained workforce.</td><td>clickworker (https://www.clickworker.com/en/crowdsourcing-glossary/cloud-labour/)</td><td>A business owner can use this very similarly to the way that researchers and other business owners use MTurk; however, the structure of the system sets clear guidelines and allows the owner to expect a certain quality of the work completed.<br /><br />Workers can expect training and a host of regulations and rules to learn that will allow CloudFactory to do quality control.</td><td>More contributors than users</td><td>Anyone can contribute, though they do have a core staff that manages the site and production. However, signing up as a worker is as simple as watching a video and verifying your credentials.<br />Note that some of the job requirements are extremely specific - they really are looking for the high end of the workforce. For example, a job listing right now requires a Bachelor&#39;s in Business Administration, over 7 years experience working in the US/Europe, 5 years professional project management experience, and so forth.</td><td>One thing that motivates people to contribute is that they get to work in teams. Often, groups of 8 are required to apply together before you can start working - so it is appealing to the workers that they get to be working alongside, if not physically alongside, their friends. Also, while I could not get accurate information relating to how well they pay workers, but they seem to indicate from the qualifications of the people they are hiring that it really is a wage much above what a worker can expect on MTurk.</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>The company generates revenue by being paid by other companies for managing the workforce.</td><td>Above, I mentioned the extremely strict qualifications required to do many of their jobs, such as having years of professional experience, even a 4-year degree in business, etc. Their workers are highly educated and professional.</td><td>No</td><td>N/A</td><td>No</td><td>N/A</td><td>There is no information on this</td><td>Specific services are broken into categories (text, voice, images, web) and a user signs up for the service, contracting a solution with CloudFactory. Then contributers handle the backend, and results are funneled from CloudFactory to the contracting company. Generally speaking, this service is not done for individuals or researchers, but rather as a business model.</td><td>While there is not a count of users, they aim to reach an employment of &#34;1 million&#34;, but only have roughly 26 thousand facebook likes.</td><td>I&#39;m not sure what this means, but their total equity funding is $5.7 million.</td><td>I think this would work well. They probably could use their own service. In fact, it&#39;s one of the key points the company makes in its presentations - that their workforce is scaleable without the loss of control over quality or price.</td><td>This company seems too small to attract any type of controversy. According to LinkedIn, they have a workforce between 1001-5000 workers, and from the very little amount of attention they get on the internet, there&#39;s not much to talk about. Considering how they compare to current models, I don&#39;t believe they could be the target of controversy. Paraphrased from their site: they believe talent is equally distributed around the world, but opportunity is not. How can that be controversial?</td><td>I feel like most of the informattion on the website and in articles around it were more promotional due to their social vision of bringing jobs to a workforce that does not currently have the oportunity to use their talents. however, most of it&#39;s procedural information is kept until the money flows. Therefore, it&#39;s very difficult to evaluate from the outside.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>",

In the past, when I&#39;ve worked with BeautifulSoup, I&#39;ve stored all of the HTML contents locally, but is that a bad design choice, considering the URL list could be really, really big.\u00a0I&#39;m trying to think about whether one approach is more efficient, or if it&#39;s a trivial design choice that does not really matter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",

Nupedia had strict rules and qualifications for who could edit and write articles. This resulted in extremely slow growth. The creators of Nupedia wanted to speed it up, so they decided to adopt a wiki model, where anyone could contribute to any article, but that was met with resistance from the users of the website, so they broke it off into its own project, Wikipedia. <br /><br />The AI edit helper was created to encourage more contribution to articles. The contributing experience was very unfriendly to newcomers, so Wikipedia loosened up the restrictions and created an artificial intelligence algorithm to automatically detect malicious edits.</td><td>Non-profit organization</td><td>The company provides a free encyclopedia that anyone can use online.</td><td>Updates a previous model</td><td>Nupedia, an online encyclopedia, that had much stricter restrictions about who could edit the articles on the site.</td><td>http://www.encyclopedia.com/ (free)<br />http://www.britannica.com/ (pay to use, based off print)<br /><br />a somewhat complete list of online encyclopedias is available here:<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_encyclopedias</td><td>If you want to learn more about a company (say Netflix), you can go to wikipedia&#39;s website and search for &#39;Netflix&#39;, where there is a rich, informative article, written by unpaid contributors, that explains all about the company, its origin, awards it has won, controversies it was involved in, etc. <br /><br />the AI helper will automatically flag any edits with a rating, and whether it thinks the edit is good or bad, allowing humans to more easily handle malicious, biased, or incorrect edits.</td><td>More users than contributors</td><td>Anyone with internet access can contribute to wikipedia. According to the website, about 70,000 people are regular contributors.</td><td>The people are motivated to contribute simply because they enjoy spreading knowledge to the world and improving a free resource. There is also an indirect system of rewards, watched articles, and other resources that allow contributors to improve their reputation among the community.</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Wikipedia is entirely funded by small donations from users and large donations from other companies, such as Google and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.</td><td>The contributions of others who watch many articles, and also an AI algorithm that detects malicious edits. Users or IP addresses that have been flagged for bad edits are sometimes blocked from contributing any more.</td><td>No</td><td></td><td>No</td><td></td><td>The contributions are a series of edits to the original articles (also written by the contributors). The latest edit is the one that appears online for the world to see.</td><td>The service is not often advertised anymore, as it is one of the 10 most visited sites on the internet, but it is usually billed as &#34;the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.&#34; The contributors contribute by going to an article they want to edit, then you can either make an account, or simply edit the page as your IP address. In the end, users get access to a huge base of knowledge about almost anything they wish to learn.</td><td>374 million unique visitors monthly (as of last september)</td><td>N/A</td><td>It would be very difficult to scale Wikipedia to 100 times its current size, as I&#39;m not sure that much information exists to add, however, it is one of the largest bases of information currently on the internet, and there is no real incentive scheme, so I believe it is scaleable, as long as the contributors remain the same quality and the AI editor quality continues to improve.</td><td>In the past there were questions about its revenue generating model, and the donations it has solicited. Currently, Wikipedia is awash with cash (it even has a lobbyist), and still asks for donations every holiday season.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>",

Elance was founded in 1999 by Beerud Sheth.</td><td>Since Upwork was formed by merging two existing companies, its origin story is not especially interesting. Elance and oDesk merged to form Elance-oDesk, combining ideas, technology and resources. With the oDesk platform as the foundation, Upwork kept the best of both original companies and worked to add new innovations.</td><td>Privately held company</td><td>Upwork creates an global online workplace for clients and businesses to find freelance professionals. These professionals can be anything from writers to an entire team of professionals.</td><td>Updates a previous model</td><td>Upwork is a combination/update of Elance and oDesk.</td><td>There are many other freelance platform services. Some are listed below:<br />Toptal<br />Freelancer<br />Craigslist (parts of it)<br />Guru<br />iFreelance<br />CrowdSource<br />Outsource.com</td><td>If you are looking to hire a freelancer, you list your needs and Upwork matches you with the freelance professionals. Clients using Upwork can be anyone from large companies to small businesses to single individuals.</td><td>More contributors than users</td><td>Anyone with some professional skill and/or experience (as well as Internet of course) can create a freelancer profile on Upwork with their resume and accomplishments. Since it is free to join Upwork, the people who contribute services come from a large variety of backgrounds.</td><td>One major selling point of Upwork is flexibility and freedom. People can work from home and do not need to commute anymore. Freelancers can also choose which jobs to accept and which clients to work with. Additionally, Upwork provides opportunities to work with clients worldwide. Finally, Upwork also helps freelancers manage their projects and helps ensure that they get paid.</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Upwork collects 10 percent of the payment to the independent professional. No fee is charged to those offering jobs.</td><td>Upwork has voluntary skill tests as well as a feedback/reputation system to help clients find freelancers they can trust. The clients can interview the freelancers that want the job and the two parties can agree upon either hourly pay or fixed-price contracts. Upwork also has a timesheet application that tracks the work of freelancers. In addition to tracking time, the app also takes screenshots to ensure that freelancers are billing fairly. Finally, in the case of disputes, Upwork has a 24/7 customer service team and also helps with dispute resolution.</td><td>Yes</td><td>The intents of the government regulations are to protect company employees. Previously, employers had classified some of their employees as independent contractors/freelancers to avoid paying certain taxes and to avoid properly compensating their workers. Upwork meets these standards because all of the contributors are independent contractors/freelancers, so they are not being misclassified.</td><td>Yes</td><td>Upwork uses a feedback system based on a Job Success score and a Top Rated status. The Job Success score is a percentage that is positively influenced by factors including client feedback, long-term relationships, and repeat contracts and is negatively influenced by factors such as contracts without activity and lack of communication or feedback. A Job Success score of over 90% is considered very good. Upwork members can earn a Top Rated status if they have a Job Success score of over 90%, have over $1000 in earnings in the past year, have an up-to-date and completed profile, have accurate availability statuses for new jobs and contracts, and have no recent account holds. Freelancers with these reputation points are more trustworthy and reliable in the eyes of the clients due to a strong track record. There are also client profiles with freelancer feedback that the freelancers can browse to decide if they want to work for a certain client.</td><td>The contributions are not aggregated.</td><td>Based on their needs, users are matched with professionals. The users can browse profiles and proposals to decide who they want to hire. The contributors can look at comments on user profiles to decide if they want to work for a given user. There is also a real-time chat platform to help in this process. After payment terms are negotiated, the contributors do the work they are contracted to do. They must do their work in a reasonable time period to avoid affecting their Job Success scores. Finally, the contributors are paid through Upwork&#39;s escrow system and the users receive the work that was completed.</td><td>Over 4 million registered clients</td><td>Over $1 billion in annual work done</td><td>Since the contributors are not aggregating their work for the clients, if the company were to scale up, the current business model would probably still work. The incentive scheme wouldn&#39;t need to change because the users and contributors can still agree on the payment scheme with Upwork taking 10% of the payments. The quality model would also still work because every interaction is between a single user and a single contributor so the feedback system would probably still work. There is not really an aggregation model for Upwork. Considering the company is already operating on the scale of millions of users and contributors, scaling up 10 or 100 times more would probably not break Upwork&#39;s business model.</td><td>I couldn&#39;t find any major controversies.</td><td>Another URL of a company logo:<br />https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mIX6bt5CO50/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFRA/sEZIkAmGXjw/s0-c-k-no-ns/photo.jpg</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>",

The majority of the time we&#39;ve spent have been either fixing errors in the initial code skeleton or dealing with things like the xpath, which I didn&#39;t feel like was well-explained in either the homework page, in class, or on Piazza.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think also that I&#39;m frustrated in general because I&#39;m also OCR-ing at the current moment as well as taking four other courses, each with a substantial time investment. I&#39;ve taken other project courses such as CIS 350 and I think that the scope of the weekly homework assignments so far have much more time consuming than the semester-long projects in that and other classes, which doesn&#39;t make sense to me given that the description for NETS 213 says that students of any major who have taken CIS 120 can take this class, and I definitely don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m sorry if this makes me sound petulant; it&#39;s very late right now and I am\u00a0still waiting for our program to extract all the text from the articles, and my partner and I started on Sunday, since I couldn&#39;t start earlier due to being off campus for OCR. I understand we have late days, but I also feel that even given my comp sci background, this homework was far more substantial than could have been completed in a week for people with little to no Python experience, and taking other classes as well.\u00a0</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi all!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We have finished grading your classifier assignments, and you should get your grades shortly if you have not already (look for an email from Kate!). You guys did very well overall. It was not an easy assignment and there were\u00a0a lot of new concepts that you had to take in (and new packages you had to install) all at once, so very well done.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There were two\u00a0common points of confusion. Please feel free to ask questions here or in OHs if you are having trouble with these concepts, since they are important if you intend to do more ML in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>What exactly are\u00a0X and y? What are their dimensions?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>In short, y is a vector of labels (one label per article). X is a matrix of features (one row per article, one column per feature). (You might\u00a0prefer\u00a0to think of X as a\u00a0list of vectors of features).\u00a0A key point is that\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">every article has a value for every feature</span>-- so every article (row) has the same number of features (columns) associated with it. What changes are\u00a0the values of those features (e.g. 0 or 1 in our assignment). Since the &#34;features&#34; in our case\u00a0were words, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">the number of features (number of columns of X) is equal to the number of words in our vocabulary</span> (this was probably ~300,000-500,000 in our dataset, depending on your preprocessing). If the\u00a0word appeared in the article, the\u00a0value for the\u00a0word is 1 for that article, and if it did not appear, the\u00a0value is 0.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You are not alone if you find this concept a bit abstract. The biggest hurdle to overcome when learning about ML is getting comfortable thinking about your data as a feature matrix. Once you have internalized this notion, the rest of ML is reasonably straightforward. Please, ask us questions!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>False positives and false negatives\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Many of you were confused by the concept of false positives and false negatives. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">A *false positive* in our case is an article that should have been labeled &#34;not gun related&#34; (0) but was falsely labeled &#34;gun related&#34; (1).</span> These were likely articles with words like &#34;shoot&#34; but which referred to sports or movies instead of violent crimes. A *false negative* is\u00a0an article that should have been labeled &#34;gun related&#34; (1) but was falsely labeled &#34;not gun related&#34; (0). Its good to think about these different types of errors when you are working on prediction tasks-- often different types of errors have different costs, or one type of error is worse than another.\u00a0\u00a0(E.g. in medicine, tests that produce many false negatives\u00a0are usually considered worse that ones that produce false positives. I&#39;m sure you can think of some reasons why?)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>But what now? My life has been so empty since turning in that classifier assignment...\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Many of you have expressed interest in learning more about machine learning, and you should absolutely consider enrolling in <a href=\"https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~cis520/wiki/\" target=\"_blank\">penn&#39;s ML course</a>\u00a0or <a href=\"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis519/fall2015/\" target=\"_blank\">penn&#39;s intro ML course</a>. Or check out the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\" target=\"_blank\">Coursera course</a>\u00a0(crowdsourcing woot woot!). If you can&#39;t wait that long,\u00a0you have all the freedom in the world to build an ML component into your final project, and we are more than happy to help you do so!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope everyone has\u00a0a relaxing, happy weekend!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>#pin</p>",

As I believe Chris mentioned in class, there are a lot of good reasons to use Mechanical Turk for this assignment-- MTurk gives you a *lot* more flexibility over how you grade/approve/pay your workers, whereas CrowdFlower is quite restrictive. I would recommend one of the following:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) Switching to MTurk, if you or your partner are able to create an account. This is probably your best option.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) Switch the task you are using (e.g. don&#39;t use a word search, but think of something else). You will need to make sure your new task has all of the important properties of the word search task in order to stay true to the original study, for example, it is important\u00a0that the task allows you to measure\u00a0varying degrees of effort.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) Post your task with no QC at all, and offer very low or no pay, and then grade the tasks yourself offline\u00a0(either manually or with a script) and pay workers afterward via bonuses. This may not give you good results because workers may not accept your tasks if they don&#39;t trust you to bonus them, or spammers might use up all the no-QC tasks before any good workers can do them.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4) There is a way to customize the QC on CrowdFlower but it requires running your own server that can\u00a0process CF&#39;s requests as they come in. If you are comfortable with this kind of thing and want to go this route, I can forward you an email with the instructions for how to set it up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>--Ellie</p>",

But like you said, if every person&#39;s inputs are weighted equally, those upsets are exactly where aggregating over huge numbers of picks would fail. You could instead assess predictor quality based on previous years&#39; brackets and identify people who are great at predicting upset victories, and weight their inputs more heavily than the casual observer&#39;s - tons of ways to apply the material of this class to March Madness. :)\u00a0</p>",

If you were to implement this programmatically, you would only keep one data structure for url_labels, and one for worker_qualities, and in each iteration, you would overwrite the old values.

Now, I assume that they knew that some of those were definitely mountains (&#34;gold labels&#34;) but, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I believe they were using me to help label their images for free, and I, as the &#34;contributor,&#34; did not have much choice since I forgot my password.

It is also a reminder that all guns should be treated as though they are loaded\\, muzzles should be pointed in a safe direction\\, and you should not put your finger on the trigger unless you INTEND to shoot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;comments&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>What could be the cause of this?</p>",

I think that&#39;s somewhat lacking in linear algebra. Not that it can&#39;t be done in an engaging way, but that it&#39;s easier to sit at the front of the room and explain then correct misconceptions than it is to converge on some understanding as a crowd.\u00a0I&#39;m optimistic that the way math is taught will improve over time, and that it will become simpler to make learning math engaging (and therefore more suitable for an effective MOOC).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A good\u00a0counterexample to the idea that only experts can be great contributors/participants in the sciences is fold.it - the volume of non-expert attempts is what makes it an effective way to study how proteins fold.\u00a0</p>"

You can&#39;t say that my interpretation is somehow &#34;wrong&#34; just as how I can&#39;t tell you that your interpretation is &#34;wrong&#34;. By allowing essentially mass, free discussion, more of these interpretations of poetry are generated and everyone is better off.

In these fields, there is an objective &#34;right&#34; and an objective &#34;wrong&#34;.
