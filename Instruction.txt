Our final product involves using a machine learning clustering algorithm to provide similar questions to the question that a student types in on piazza.
The first part of the crowdsourcing aspect:
When a student types in a question that he/she wants to ask on piazza, our clustering algorithm will suggest him/her a list of questions. (This is where we obtain data from the crowd to do further analysis.)
We will record the question that the student types in and a list of suggested questions (5 questions) provided by the algorithm. Then, we will upload these questions to the crowdflower platform.
The second part of the crowdsourcing aspect:
On our crowdflower platform, we will ask crowd workers to compare each of the 5 suggested questions to the question that the student types in. Before the crowd can start answering questions, they will have to pass our golden standard questions before they can start doing the real task that we post. We will be providing crowd workers with checkboxes. What they only need to do is to check which suggested question is similar to the question that the student types in. If none of the suggested question is similar to the question that the students type in, the crowd worker should select none of them is similar.
Then, we will compile the results and feed the results back into our clustering algorithm in order to provide better suggested question for piazza.
